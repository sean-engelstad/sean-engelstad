Hi, I'm Sean Engelstad, a Master's Aerospace Engineering student at Georgia Tech
I work in the Structural Analysis and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Research lab (SMDO) at Georgia Tech under Dr. Graeme Kennedy
My research interests include aeroelasticity, structural analysis, and fluid mechanics. I have also gotten into machine learning recently.
