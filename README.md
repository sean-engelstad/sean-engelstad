I'm a Master's student in Aerospace Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I work in the Structural Analysis and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Research lab (SMDO) at Georgia Tech under Dr. Graeme Kennedy. My research interests include aeroelasticity, structural analysis, and fluid mechanics. I also work on machine learning from time to time.
